## Installation

From your Redmine plugins directory, clone this repository as `redmine_slack` (note
the underscore!):

    git clone https://github.com/sciyoshi/redmine-slack.git redmine_slack

You will also need the `httpclient` dependency, which can be installed by running

    bundle install

from the plugin directory.

Restart Redmine, and you should see the plugin show up in the Plugins page.
Under the configuration options, set the Slack API URL to the URL for an
Incoming WebHook integration in your Slack account.

## @mentions

You can create a user custom field named "Slack Username". It will trigger a notification if a user has its Slack username in the custom field.

## Customized Routing

You can also route messages to different channels on a per-project basis. To
do this, create a project custom field (Administration > Custom fields > Project)
named `Slack Channel`. If no custom channel is defined for a project, the parent
project will be checked (or the default will be used). To prevent all notifications
from being sent for a project, set the custom channel to `-`.
